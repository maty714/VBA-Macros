# VBA-Macros

This houses all projects made with VBA to help automate tasks at work

**About:**
These were the first programs I have ever built. After identifying streamlining issues at work, I decided to learn VBA through a Udemy course [here](https://www.udemy.com/course/excel-vba-and-macros-course/). . These programs saved days of work.


**Description:**

PAV was used to create multiple emails with information derived from a report and send them automatically. Each email contained check images and affiliated information. This was the very first Macro I made.

BP_Entry was used to take information from reports and format them into a Journal Entry. This was the second Macro I made.


**Lessons Learned:**

Throughout my time learning code and creating these, I identifying three beginner mistakes all prevalent in the first macro (PAV)

1. Naming Convention
2. Variable Reuse
3. Proper comments

I believe I got better with these over time when creating the second macro BP_Entry in which I was able to reuse variables, and have better naming convention for the variables.
